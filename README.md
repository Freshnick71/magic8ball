# magic8ball

Growing up I never got to experience the joys of having a magical 8 ball so I decided I wanted to go about try implementing my own version of the concept online so I learned how to implement HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my code. My hope is that my magic 8 ball can become accessible to the CSH main website page so that all members of the org can also use and play around with the magical 8 ball. How the magical 8 ball works is that you can think of a question in your head and click on the button which will generate a random response to the user every single time. I know my project might not be as grand as the rest of the other amazing projects passed this semester but it was a project I created so that anyone can have fun with and enjoy and I'm greatly proud of it. Though my level of technical skill isn't in the same league as most CSHers, I won't give up until I'm able to reach that level and I will keep working towards that goal with each major project I work on.
