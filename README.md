# magic8ball

Growing up I never got to experience the joys of having a magical 8 ball so I decided I wanted to go about try implementing my own version of the concept online so I learned how to implement HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my code. My hope is that my magic 8 ball can become accessible to the CSH main website page so that all members of the org can also use and play around with the magical 8 ball. I know my project might not be as grand as the rest of the other amazing projects passed this semester but it was a project I created so that anyone can have fun with and enjoy and I'm greatly proud of it. Though my level of technical skill isn't in the same league as most CSHers, I won't give up until I'm able to reach that level and I will keep working towards that goal with each major project I work on. Project: http://magic-8-ball-git-magic8ball.apps.okd4.csh.rit.edu/ Slides presentation pitch: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11FMPWi3UwJzPOhm9bX6oyXrEdv8rD0h6-Nj2IVr3NfI/edit#slide=id.g11f1aeb5688_0_18

Demo Functionality:
Basically you click button and it will generate two user input field text blocks; Enter your're name and the question you wish to ask and the Csh magic 8 ball will scower through the universe and provide an response with it generated Api (Of which I'm still working on).
